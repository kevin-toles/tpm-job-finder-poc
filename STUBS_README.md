### 5. ResumeUploader Service
- **Location:** `src/resume/uploader.py`
- **Class:** `ResumeUploader`
- **Current State:** Stub service for uploading resume files and registering metadata; no UI yet.
- **Intended Usage:** Backend service to accept resume files (txt/pdf), register metadata, and store securely. UI can be added later for user interaction.
- **Integration Points:** Integrate with a simple UI or API route for file upload. Extend methods to handle file storage and metadata registration in DB or file system.
# TPM Job Finder POC - Stubbed Components Overview

This README documents all stubbed components and functionalities in the codebase. It provides an overview of their current configuration, intended usage, and integration points for future development and deployment.

## Overview
This project is a modular, extensible system for job/resume matching, analytics, and feedback. Several components are currently stubbed to enable future integration with external services, databases, and advanced ML/LLM features.

## Stubbed Components & Functionalities

### 1. Database Integration
- **Location:** `src/output_utils.py`
- **Function:** `save_to_database(records, db_config=None)`
- **Current State:** Stub function; does not save to any database.
- **Intended Usage:** Will save job/resume matching results to a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for persistence, analytics, and querying.
- **Integration Points:** Replace file-based output with database storage when hosting/deploying. Accepts records and optional DB config.

### 2. LLM Provider Integration
- **Location:** `src/enrichment/resume_feedback_generator.py`
- **Class:** `ResumeFeedbackGenerator(llm_provider=None)`
- **Current State:** Accepts an optional LLM provider; feedback generation via LLM is stubbed and can be extended.
- **Intended Usage:** Integrate with external LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Azure) to generate advanced resume feedback.
- **Integration Points:** Pass an LLM provider instance to enable LLM-driven feedback. Extend `get_feedback` method for API calls.

### 3. ML Scoring API & Embeddings Service
- **Location:** `src/ml_scoring_api.py`, `src/embeddings_service.py`, `src/ml_training_pipeline.py` (stubs)
- **Current State:** Placeholder modules/classes for future ML model scoring, embeddings, and training workflows.
- **Intended Usage:** Integrate with ML models/services for advanced scoring, semantic search, and analytics.
- **Integration Points:** Connect to model endpoints, training pipelines, or embedding engines as needed.

### 4. Analytics Feedback Loop
- **Location:** `src/import_analysis.py`, `src/analytics_shared.py`
- **Current State:** Analytics results can be consumed by stubbed ML/LLM modules for model improvement.
- **Intended Usage:** Use analysis results to retrain models, update feedback logic, or inform LLM prompts.
- **Integration Points:** Pass results to ML/LLM consumers via shared schema or direct function calls.

## How to Extend Stubs
- Review each stubâ€™s docstring and function signature for integration details.
- Implement the required logic (e.g., database save, API calls) when ready to deploy or connect external services.
- Update this README as new stubs are added or existing ones are implemented.

## Project Goal
To provide a robust, enterprise-ready foundation for job/resume matching, analytics, and feedback, with clear extension points for future ML, LLM, and database integrations.
