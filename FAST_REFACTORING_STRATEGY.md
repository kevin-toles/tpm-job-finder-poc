# Fast Microservice Refactoring Strategy

## Philosophy: Blunt Force + Just-In-Time Wiring

Given our development speed with Copilot (entire application built in ~5 days), we can refactor components to microservices very quickly without complex adapter layers.

## Strategy

### **Phase 1: Fast Component → Service Refactoring**
- **Build complete microservice** (service + tests + API)
- **Move old component** to DEPRECATED immediately  
- **Update imports** to new service contracts
- **Fix any breaking changes** immediately

### **Phase 2: Just-In-Time Application Wiring** 
- **If application needs to run** during refactoring
- **Create minimal connectors** for non-migrated components only
- **Throw away connectors** as soon as components are migrated

## Implementation

### Current Workflow (Per Component)
```bash
# Day 1: Refactor audit_logger → audit_service
1. Complete audit_service implementation (2-3 hours)
2. Move audit_logger/ → DEPRECATED/audit_logger/ 
3. Update all imports to use audit_service contracts
4. Fix breaking changes immediately
5. Run tests - everything should work

# Day 2: Refactor job_aggregator → job_collection_service  
1. Complete job_collection_service (3-4 hours)
2. Move job_aggregator/ → DEPRECATED/job_aggregator/
3. Update imports and fix breaking changes
4. Run tests

# Continue pattern...
```

### If Application Needs to Run Mid-Migration
```python
# Quick connector (throw-away code)
# Only create when needed, discard immediately after next migration

# tpm_job_finder_poc/_temp_connectors/quick_wiring.py
"""
TEMPORARY: Quick connectors for running application during migration.
DELETE THIS FILE as soon as next component is migrated.
"""

def wire_legacy_components():
    """Quick wiring for any remaining non-microservice components."""
    # Minimal glue code - not meant to be permanent
    pass
```

## Benefits of Blunt Force Approach

### ✅ **Speed**
- No time spent building adapters that get thrown away
- Direct implementation of target architecture
- Copilot helps refactor very quickly

### ✅ **Clean Code**
- No temporary adapter layers
- Direct microservice implementation
- Clear architecture boundaries immediately

### ✅ **Focused Testing**
- Test new microservices directly
- No adapter compatibility testing
- Cleaner test suites

### ✅ **Simple Deployment**
- Each service is independently deployable immediately
- No migration state complexity
- Clear service boundaries

## Migration Timeline

### Estimated Timeline (with Copilot assistance)
- **audit_logger → audit_service**: 2-3 hours
- **job_aggregator → job_collection_service**: 3-4 hours  
- **enrichment → ai_intelligence_service**: 4-5 hours (complex)
- **scraping_service → web_scraping_service**: 3-4 hours
- **llm_provider → llm_gateway_service**: 2-3 hours
- **config → config_service**: 2 hours
- **storage + secure_storage → storage_service**: 3-4 hours
- **etc.**

**Total estimated time: 2-3 days for complete migration**

### Daily Plan
```
Day 1: audit_service + job_collection_service + ai_intelligence_service
Day 2: web_scraping_service + llm_gateway_service + config_service + storage_service  
Day 3: remaining services + cleanup + testing
```

## Emergency Application Running

### If We Need Working App Mid-Migration
```python
# Create minimal quick connector (1 hour max)
# tpm_job_finder_poc/quick_run.py

"""
TEMPORARY: Quick application runner during migration.
Only use if absolutely needed. Delete after migration complete.
"""

def start_application_with_mixed_architecture():
    """
    Quick wiring to run application with mix of:
    - Completed microservices
    - Remaining old components
    """
    # Wire up what's available
    # Minimal viable product approach
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("⚠️  TEMPORARY RUNNER - Migration in progress")
    start_application_with_mixed_architecture()
```

## Decision: Go Fast, Fix Forward

### **No Adapters** ❌
- Don't build temporary bridges
- Don't maintain dual APIs
- Don't create adapter complexity

### **Fast Refactor** ✅ 
- Complete microservice implementation
- Move old files to DEPRECATED immediately
- Fix all breaking changes in one go
- Test new architecture directly

### **Just-In-Time Wiring** ✅
- Only if application must run mid-migration
- Minimal throw-away connector code
- Delete as soon as next component migrated

## Implementation Plan

### Starting Now: audit_logger → audit_service
1. **Complete audit_service implementation** (GREEN phase)
2. **Move audit_logger/ → DEPRECATED/**
3. **Update all imports** to audit_service contracts
4. **Fix breaking changes** immediately
5. **Validate with tests**

This approach is much cleaner and faster given our development velocity with Copilot.
