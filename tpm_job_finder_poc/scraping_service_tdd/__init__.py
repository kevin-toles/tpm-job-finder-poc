Scraping Service TDD Package

This package contains the Test-Driven Development implementation of the
Scraping Service microservice. The implementation follows strict TDD
methodology where tests define the requirements before implementation.

TDD Process:
1. RED: Write failing tests that define the interface (COMPLETED)
2. GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass tests (IN PROGRESS)
3. REFACTOR: Optimize while keeping tests passing (PENDING)

The service will be implemented to satisfy all the interface contracts
defined in the comprehensive test suite.
