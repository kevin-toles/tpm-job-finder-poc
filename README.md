## 🔧 Configuration

### Automation Configuration
Create `tpm_job_finder_poc/config/automation_config.json`:
```json
{
  "search_params": {
    "keywords": ["technical product manager", "senior product manager"],
    "location": "Remote",
    "date_posted": "pastWeek",
    "experience_level": "senior"
  },
  "sources": {
    "api_sources": ["remoteok", "greenhouse", "lever"],
    "scraping_sources": ["indeed", "linkedin", "ziprecruiter"]
  },
  "output": {
    "format": "excel",
    "directory": "./output/",
    "filename_template": "jobs_{date}_{keywords}.xlsx"
  },
  "enrichment": {
    "enabled": true,
    "llm_provider": "openai",
    "scoring_enabled": true
  },
  "limits": {
    "max_jobs_per_source": 50,
    "total_max_jobs": 200,
    "timeout_seconds": 300
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# LLM Provider API Keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"

# Optional: Job Board API Keys
export REMOTEOK_API_KEY="your-remoteok-key"
export GREENHOUSE_API_KEY="your-greenhouse-key"

# Database Configuration
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./jobs.db"

# Logging
export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
```

## 🔍 Advanced Usage

### Custom Job Sources
Add new job sources by extending the base classes:

```python
# Updated imports using current package structure
from tpm_job_finder_poc.scraping_service.scrapers.base_scraper import BaseScraper
from tpm_job_finder_poc.scraping_service.core.base_job_source import FetchParams, JobResult

class CustomJobScraper(BaseScraper):
    source_name = "custom_site"
    
    async def fetch_jobs(self, params: FetchParams) -> List[JobResult]:
        # Implement your scraping logic
        pass
```

### Custom Enrichment
Extend the enrichment pipeline:

```python
from tpm_job_finder_poc.enrichment.orchestrator import EnrichmentOrchestrator

class CustomEnricher:
    def enrich_job(self, job_data: dict) -> dict:
        # Add custom enrichment logic
        return enhanced_job_data

# Register with orchestrator
orchestrator = EnrichmentOrchestrator()
orchestrator.register_enricher("custom", CustomEnricher())
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Health

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check modern job collection service health
python -c "
from tpm_job_finder_poc.job_collection_service.service import JobCollectionService
service = JobCollectionService(config, storage, enricher)
await service.start()
statuses = await service.get_source_statuses()
stats = await service.get_collection_statistics()
print(f'Service Health: {len(statuses)} sources configured')
print(f'Collection Stats: {stats}')
"

# Check modern job normalizer service health
python -c "
from tpm_job_finder_poc.job_normalizer_service.service import JobNormalizerService
service = JobNormalizerService(config)
await service.start()
health = await service.health_check()
stats = await service.get_normalization_statistics()
print(f'Normalizer Health: {health.status}')
print(f'Normalization Stats: {stats}')
"

# Check legacy aggregator service health
python -c "
from tpm_job_finder_poc.job_aggregator.main import JobAggregatorService
service = JobAggregatorService()
health = await service.health_check()
print(f'Legacy Service Health: {health.status}')
"

# Check scraping service health
python -c "
from tpm_job_finder_poc.scraping_service.core.orchestrator import ScrapingOrchestrator
orchestrator = ScrapingOrchestrator()
health = await orchestrator.health_check()
print(f'Scrapers: {health}')
"
```

### Audit Logging
All operations are logged with audit trails:
- Job collection events
- Enrichment operations
- User interactions
- System errors and warnings

Logs are available in:
- `app.log` - Application logs
- `audit_logger/` - Detailed audit trails
- `webhook.log` - Webhook events

## 🔐 LLM Provider API Keys & Security

### API Key Management

**How to Provide API Keys (Local & Hosted):**

1. **Local Development:**
   - Place your API keys in a file named `llm_keys.txt` in the project root:
     ```txt
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxx
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxx
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
     DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-key
     OLLAMA_API_KEY=  # leave blank for local
     ```
   - This file is in `.gitignore` and will never be committed.

2. **Hosted/CI/CD Environments:**
   - Set API keys as environment variables for security:
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_API_KEY`
   - Most cloud platforms and CI/CD systems allow you to set these securely.

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never hard-code API keys in code or commit them to version control.
- Do not store secrets in the repo. Only use local files or environment variables.
- For production, always use environment variables.
