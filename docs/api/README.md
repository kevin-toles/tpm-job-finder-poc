# Auto-generated API documentation for TPM Job Finder POC

This folder contains API docs for all major components, generated by Sphinx.

## How it works
- Sphinx autodoc pulls docstrings and API info from each Python module across the codebase
- Component-level README files are included for context and onboarding
- Docs are unified and browsable in one place
- Covers 440+ tests and comprehensive module documentation

## Regenerate docs
- Run: `sphinx-apidoc -o docs/api src`
- Then: `sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html`

## CI/CD
- Documentation builds can be automated in CI to ensure docs are always up to date.
