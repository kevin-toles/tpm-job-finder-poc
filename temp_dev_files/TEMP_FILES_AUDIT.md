## Cleanup Guidelines

### Retention Policy
- **Migration Scripts**: Keep until migration is fully validated (30+ days)
- **Debug Tools**: Keep until issue is resolved, then archive
- **Refactoring Helpers**: Keep until refactor is complete and tested
- **Logs & Dumps**: Clean weekly, keep only recent or significant logs

1. ✅ Verify file purpose is complete
2. ✅ Check if file is referenced in active work
