# Stub Catalog & Extension Guide

This document catalogs all stubbed methods, classes, and extension points in the TPM Job Finder POC codebase. Stubs are placeholders for future features, security, or integrations. Contributors can use this guide to understand where and how to extend the system for production use.

---

## What is a Stub?
A stub is a method, class, or function that is intentionally left incomplete. It usually contains a comment or minimal implementation (e.g., `pass`) and is meant to be replaced or extended in future development.

## Catalog of Stubs

### 1. Storage & Security
- **SecureStorage (src/storage/secure_storage.py):**
  - `_encryption_stub(path)`: Placeholder for encryption at rest.
  - `_access_control_stub(path)`: Placeholder for access control logic.
  - `_cloud_integration_stub(path)`: Placeholder for cloud storage integration (e.g., S3, Azure Blob).

### 2. Resume Management
- **ResumeStore (src/resume/store.py):**
  - Stubs for access control, encryption, audit logging, and API endpoints.

### 3. Enrichment & Analytics
- **Embeddings (src/enrichment/embeddings.py):**
  - Stub for semantic similarity and advanced matching.
- **Orchestrator (src/enrichment/orchestrator.py):**
  - Extension points for advanced analytics, feedback loops, and external API integration.

### 4. Test & Utility Scripts
- **Test folders:**
  - Stubs for test setup, teardown, and skipped tests for missing API keys or external services.

---

## How to Leverage Stubs
- **For Contributors:**
  - Review stub methods/classes before adding new features.
  - Replace stubs with production-ready code (e.g., implement encryption, add cloud storage logic).
  - Document any new extension points in this file and relevant module README.
- **For Architects:**
  - Use stubs to plan future upgrades and integrations.
  - Ensure all stubs are documented and tracked for roadmap planning.

---

## Updating This Catalog
- Add new stubs and extension points here as the codebase evolves.
- Reference this file in module-level READMEs for contributor onboarding.
